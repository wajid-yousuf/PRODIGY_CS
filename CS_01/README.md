This is the basic working of the program.\
First we choose a word we want to encrypt like in this example 'hello'.\
Next we are prompted to choose by how much we want to shift the value. In this case by 3.\

Results show encrypted word, also decrypted one.\
Now if we want to shift the value by any other number other than 3 we can also try that.\

Now we chose to shift the value by 4 steps we get completely different encrypted message.
